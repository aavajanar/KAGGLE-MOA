Mechanisms of Action Prediction

## Why is it important? 
Drugs work by interacting with specific proteins in our body. This is called (Mechanisms of action) However, researching which protein are affected for each drug cost resources and time. This is especially difficult for all the potential drugs available. Making a prediction from gene expression and cell viability would be cheaper and faster.

## Solution
Train an algorithm to predict the mechanism of action from gene expression and cell viability data. Cheaper and faster.
